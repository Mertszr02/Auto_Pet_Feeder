# Auto_Pet_Feeder

Wifi board integrated pet feeder

I used a servo and a door mechanism to dispense pet food at will.

Because of the occasional jamming of the door while closing(food gets stuck between the door and the body)
when this is detected and the servo open slightly and tries closing again this is repeted 8 times if it is still unable to close, it accepts defeat by the pet food and stays open to prevent breaking.

edit test...
